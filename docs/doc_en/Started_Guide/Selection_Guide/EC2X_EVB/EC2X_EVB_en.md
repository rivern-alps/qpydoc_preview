#### Implement Product Prototype

Based on the peripheral such as various sensors, buttons and LCD screens that attached to the EVB, developers can make the product prototype in a rapid way. Here are a few examples of some product prototype that can be made based on the sensors on the EVB.

- **Anti-theft and Loss Implementation**

**Background**: It refers to unattended devices such as parcel locker, charging station or charging point, which is exposed to the risk of theft or damage. As a result, these devices should be fulfilled with the features of distance control, anti-theft, and abnormal state report.

**Implementation**: It is composed by Quectel communication module, accelerometers,  GPIO (matched with vibration sensor, micro switch, relay, and LED) and speaker.

**Method**: Connect the Quectel communication module to cloud and save the parameters issued by the cloud. By reading the parameters reported by sensor, you can judge the current state , whether the vibration state surpasses the threshold, LED twinkle and alarm. After that, report all above to cloud. 

- **Micro Weather Service Station**

**Background**: Establish the unattended micro weather service station in the field, which can report temperature and humidity, wind for recording, analyzing and forecasting over network periodically. 

**Implementation**: It is composed by Quectel communication module, temperature and humidity sensor, ADC (wind and battery voltage detection) and GPIO (battery charge and discharge state detection)

**Method**: Connect the Quectel communication module to cloud and save the parameter issued by the cloud. Then make the internal clock synchronous by NTP. After that, read the parameters reported by temperature and humidity sensor and ADC. Finally, make the data sequenced in accord with cloud and report it over network. Under the circumstance of bad network condition, save data offline and report the data to cloud in good network.

- **Micro Vending Machine**

**Background**: The minibar in hotel cannot meet the demand of customers, while the micro vending machine in guest-room can mend it. The micro vending machine can not only provide goods, such as snacks, chewing gun add charging wire, but also mobile charging.

**Implementation**: It is composed by Quectel communication module, GPIO (matched with stepping motor, relay/MOS tube), lignt intensity transmitter, LCD, G-Sensor and speaker.

**Method**: Connect the Quectel communication module to cloud, then register and authenticate it to receive data issued by cloud. Corresponding QR code will be displayed on LCD screen and users can scan the QR code to purchase goods with Wechat or Alipay. After paying, the cloud will issue command to module for controlling GPIO to fulfill shipment by revolving the stepping motor. Meanwhile, the light intensity transmitter will confirm whether the shipment is complete. Or it will charge the cellphone over controlling relay or MOS tube. Once all above is done, read corresponding information such as" the shipment is complete, looking forward your visit again" by TTS. If goods-pouring or violent damage is detected by G-sensor, it will report the information to cloud automatically for operations and maintenance.

- **Barcode Scanner**

**Background**: In daily use, it is available  to use scanner to enroll in barcode and QR code in packet. However, traditional scanner should rely on PC, meanwhile, it is also complicate to scan by cellphone with bad stability and high-power consumption attached. By wireless barcode scanner, remote scan, wireless scan and continuous scan can also be achievable.

**Implementation**: It is composed by Quectel communication module, SPI Camera, LCD and keypad.

**Method**: Connect the module to cloud after the module powers on and related information will display on LCD. Users should click the keyboard to confirm firstly. Then enable the camera to scan barcode or QR code (single or continuous scan is optional) until the module identifies the information of above. Finally, report the scanned information to cloud.

- **Intellectual Control**

**Background**: By issuing runnable parameter over cloud, the module can monitor device and controller automatically so as to save labor cost.

**Implementation**: It is composed by Quectel communication module, SPI Camera, SPI, I2C, LCD and GPIO (matched with buttons and relays).

**Method**: Connect the module to cloud after the module powers on for sake of obtaining runnable parameters and saving it. Then, related controlling contents and running state will be displayed on LCD. Once the value of sensor surpasses the threshold, it will execute related operations and report to cloud with saved parameters so as to realize auto controlling. (for example, when the humidity is over 80 %, the rely as well as dehumidifier should be opened).

- **Device Positioning**

**Background**: The shared bike is developing rapidly. However, it is inevitable that customers cannot find the accurate location of the bike due to the remoteness in which it parked. As a result, it does not only affect the consumption experience but also waste lots of resources. Furthermore, the real time can also not be confirmed.

**Implementation**: It is composed by Quectel communication module and L76K (GNSS module).

**Method**: The L76K is used to get location information and output NEMA sentence. Then the NEMA sentence can be read by the serial port of the module. After that, transfer the data to cloud (for example, Alibaba Cloud) to get real time sharing in the connected network.

- Whether the EVB is connected to PC (damage in data cable or socket, insufficient power supply)

- Whether the EVB is booted correctly

- Whether the USB driver is installed correctly USB

- Whether the motherboard driver is correctly installed to PC 

If this cannot be ruled out, please connect Quectel with quecpython@Quectel.com.

### Download Firmware

Note: The original firmware in the module may not the QuecPython firmware, so it is recommended to download QuecPython firmware first.

What is QuecPython firmware (hereinafter abbreviated as "FW") and why should you download it?  The FW is a binary program that contains resource like driver, BL, FS, and VM. A module without FW is just like the old saying: one cannot make bricks without straw. While after downloading that, the module can work. Generally, The FW to Quectel communication module is what operation system to PC. Similarly, the user script to QuecPython FW is what application to operation system. Only install the operation system to PC as well as various applications can the PC execute corresponding operations and commands.

<font color='red'>  **Notes**</font>

1. **How to get the QuecPython FW? Please download it from QuecPython official website <https://python.quectel.com/download>  **
2. **Different modules are varied in FW, so cross-downloading firmware is not supported. If there is a mistake, please correct it and download the corresponding FW. Otherwise the FW cannot work. Take EC200U as an example, it is divided into EC200UCNAA, EC200UEUAB and EC200UCNLB, which do not support cross-downloading among these modules.**
3. **About FW, owing to the FW zip file downloaded from the official website contains FW package and change log, the FW file needs to be unzip one layer before you obtain the downloaded FW package. The suffix of the module FW package of ASR platform is .bin, and .pac serves as the suffix in both EC200U and EC600U.**
4. **Before you download FW, it is recommended to confirm the FW version first so as to avoid degrading or downloading the wrong version. After the FW is downloaded, all contents in user area will be empty (currently, some FW versions support retaining important parameters. see [Securedata - secure data area](https://python.quectel.com/wiki/#/en-us/api/QuecPythonClasslib?id=securedata-secure-data-area) for details).**

Steps to download FW with QPYcom

1. After downloading QPYcom, you can unzip it to any directory and double click **QPYcom.exe** to run.

2. Connect the EVB to PC and power on the EVB.

3. Click "**Download**" to enter downloading page.

4. Create project name in the left navigation bar and click "**Choose FW**".

5. Left click the inverted triangle in the bottom-right corner and select "**Download FW**" in the pop-up menu . Then click "**Download FW** ", the tool will get down to downloading FW automatically.

| Tips                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| When downloading FW, **you do not need to select serial port** since the tool will select serial port automatically and download it. Please do not exit tool or plug out the serial port, which may cause the module to become bricked.
| Never plug in two or more EVBs at the same time so as to avoid the unidentified situation, even worse, results in the error in downloading. |

<img src="media/download_FW_03.png" style="zoom:100%;" />

<img src="media/download_finish.png" style="zoom:100%;" />

After the download completes, you can send AT commands with the methods in next chapter or test whether the FW download is correct over "**REPL**" page.

### Verify Firmware Version

Open the corresponding serial port in "Quectel USB AT Port" over QCOM_V1.6 (Following conditions should be set beforehand: baud rate 115200, 1 stop bit, no parity check, 8 bytes-size and no HW flow control). Tick "**Send With Enter**" and send "**AT+GMR**" to check the return value of the module, that is, the current FW version.

<img src="media/QCOM_check_firmware_version.png" style="zoom:100%;" />

If the return value is the QuecPython FW version, the query result usually contains Quecpython related characters such as **PY** or **QPY**.

It is also available to verify whether the current FW version is the QuecPython FW over QPYcom, which is an official graphical tool.

Download address of QPYcom: <https://python.quectel.com/download>

The specific download location is shown in the figure below:

<img src="media/QPYcom_position.png" alt="QPYcom_position" style="zoom:100%;" />

Steps to check FW version with QPYcom:

    ![start](media/start.png)

6. You can also import the example module and run the Python script using the exec method.

```python
 import example  
 example.exec('usr/helloworld.py')
```

The running result is shown in the figure below:

<img src="media/Running_results.png" style="zoom:100%;" />

- Run automatically after power on

In QuecPython, it supports executing user codes automatically after power on. After the module boots an runs,  QuecPython will check the program file named *`main.py`* in user partition and execute it automatically. Therefore, if you want to run your own codes after the module powers on, you need to name the program as *`main.py`*  and download it to the module together with its dependent files.

| Tips                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| The file name shall be *`main.py`* (Cases should be coincide completely) and it should be placed in the user partition to run automatically after boot. If *`main.py`* calls other *py* and *mpy* files, which should be downloaded into user partition. |

Take *`helloworld.py`*  as an example. Define a method for *`helloworld.py`* file: Print " hello world! " string with a period of 1 s. The method in *`helloworld.py`* is called in the *`main.py`* file.

```python
#helloworld.py code
import utime
def prtHelloworld():
    while True:
        print("hello world")
        utime.sleep(1)
```

```python
# main.pyÔºö
# Call helloworld.py file
import helloworld
# Call rtHelloworld() in helloworld.py file
helloworld.prtHelloworld()
```

(1) In terms of the file name should be imported, it is recommended to use pure English instead of name which contains special character such as blank.

(2) For the *py* file in dual-file system, two methods are acceptable to import:

Method 1: 

		from usr import helloworld	# helloworld means py file name

		helloworld.prtHelloworld() 	# Call *prtHelloworld()* in helloworld

Method 2: 

		import usr.helloworld 	# It means the *`helloworld.py`* file under usr directory

		usr.helloworld.prtHelloworld() 	# Note: In this method, *usr* should be prefixed.

(3) Integrating above two methods, which can be extended: 

		from usr.helloworld import *	# Reference all methods in *helloworld* file

		prtHelloworld() 	# This import * has been done, as a result, call the function name directory.

Download two files mentioned above to the module (<a href="/docsite/docs/en-us/Started_Guide/Selection_Guide/EC2X_EVB/code/test_code.7z" target="_blank">Download codes</a>).

After the file is download successfully, QPYcom at the time of this document release and subsequent tools will automatically restart the virtual machine. The code will run and output the running results after *`main.py`* is downloaded. If it cannot run automatically, you can press "**RESET**" on the EVB to reboot the module, and then reconnect the interactive serial port and enter the **REPL** interface to see the automatic running result.

| If the automatic running is a failure, please check whether the errors on grammar or calling exist in *py* file. |

| Note                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| You can press **Ctrl+C** to stop automatic running or looping output scripts. If the module goes into [Interactive protect ](https://python.quectel.com/wiki/#/en-us/api/QuecPythonThirdlib?id=system-set-system), the script cannot be terminated. At this time, there is only one way to stop running : reload the FW. |
